  description: "To evaluate the appropriateness of a cure model when analyzing right-censored end points of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in malignancy in the presence of long-term survivors. We aim to derive how the ratio estimation of censored cured subjects (RECeUS), previously proposed for a homogeneous population, could be extended for use in RCTs."
